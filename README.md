[Zemoga Front End Development - Candidate Test v2.1](https://github.com/zemoga/ui-test)

## Demo

[Demo](https://rule-of-thumb-alpha.vercel.app)

## Tecnologies

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Saas](https://sass-lang.com)
- [Mongoose.js](https://mongoosejs.com)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

To run this application locally you must have at least NodeJS and NPM or YARN installed.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

## Dev

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/get-celebrities](http://localhost:3000/api/get-celebrities) and [http://localhost:3000/api/get-post-vote](http://localhost:3000/api/post-vote). This endpoints can be edited in `pages/api/` folder.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Build

Run one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

Generates an optimized version of the application for production.

This output is generated inside the `/.next` folder:

## Test

Run one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run test
# or
yarn test
```

To run the unit test with [jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [@testing-library/react](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/)

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy the app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

When deploying to Vercel, the platform automatically detects Next.js, runs next build, and optimizes the build output for you
